# hello-world
a place to store ideas, resources, and even share and discuss things with others

I am a 27 year old computer science student at a university on the west coast of Canada 
I got into programming after trying CS on a whim - conditional branching caught my attention
I enjoy running and cycling
And listening to music such as Snarky Puppy, Mall Grab, Yussef Kamaal, and Baltra
I would to become a pro CSer
